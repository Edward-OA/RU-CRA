    The process

1.  Break the desired UI into components and establish the component tree

2.  Build a Static version in REACT(without state)

3.  Thinking about state:
    when to use state
    types of state (localvs global)
    where to place each state

4.  Establish data flow:
    one-way data flow
    child-to-parent communication
    Accessing global state

step 3 and 4 are called state management

5. You'll be able to answer questions like

how to break up my UI design into components,

how to make some of my components truly reusable,

or how to assemble a user interface from reusable components.

Now, we also think a lot about state,

like what pieces of state do I need

for the interactivity that I want

and where to then place each of these states,

or in other words,

what component should actually own each piece of state,

or what types of state can or should I use,

How to make data flow through the application
